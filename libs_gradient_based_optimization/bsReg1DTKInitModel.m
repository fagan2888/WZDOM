% INPUT
%
% x             is a column vector; refers to the parameter to be estimated.
%
% GOptParam.xInit is a column vector; refers to the initial guess of x
%

% OUTPUT
% f             is a scalar; refers to |x-x_0|_2^2.
%
% g             is a column vector; refers to the gradient of |x-x_0|_2^2 with respect to x.
