% INPUT
%
% x: is a column vector; refers to the parameter to be estimated.
%
% bounds.lower: is a column vector; refers to the lower bound
% of parameter x.
%
% bounds.upper: is a column vector; refers to the upper bound
% of parameter x.
%
% bounds.active: is a logical value; The projection function is activated 
% when it is equal to 1.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% OUTPUT
% px: is a column vector; refers to the projection P(x).
%
% gpx: is a column vector; refers to the gradient of
% P(x) with respect to parameter x.
